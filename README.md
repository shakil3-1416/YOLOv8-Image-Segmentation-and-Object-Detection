# YOLOv8-Image-Segmentation-and-Object-Detection
This repo showcases image segmentation and object detection with YOLOv8. It includes steps to download an image, preprocess it, and use YOLOv8 for predictions. Results include class names and bounding box coordinates.

# Features
Preprocessing: Resizes the image to the required dimensions for YOLOv8.

Model: Utilizes YOLOv8 for detecting and segmenting objects in images.

Results: Outputs predicted object classes and bounding box coordinates.
